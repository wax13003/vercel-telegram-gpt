# Telegram Bot using Flask, Webhooks, and Vercel

Welcome to this repository, where you will learn how to create your own Telegram bot using Flask, Telegram's Webhooks, and use Vercel for deployment.

## Prerequisites
- A Telegram account and the Telegram app installed on your device
- A Vercel account
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask
- OpenAI API key
- Telebot package
- Node.js and npm installed

## Setting up your Telegram Bot
1. Open the Telegram app and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send the command `/newbot` to create a new bot
3. Follow the prompts to set a name and username for your bot
4. Save the generated token, as you will need it later

## Setting up your Flask App
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file and add your Telegram bot token  OpenAI API key
3. Optionally you can also add a OpenAI API key to enable the `/gpt` command
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Visit the [telebot docs](https://pytba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html) to get a rundown on how to make more complex responses.


## Deployment on Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel or
2. Run `npm i -g vercel` to install vercel
3. Run `vercel auth` to authenticate
4. Run `vercel` the first time to set up the itegrationto deploy the app
5. Run `vercel dev` to test the application locally
6. Run `vercel secrets add [secret-name] [secret-value]` to set your tokens
7. Run `vercel deploy` to deploy the application as a preview

## Setting up Webhooks

1. Run the `app.py` script use the URL of your Vercel-deployed app as the webhook URL

## Implementing GPT-3
1. In the `app.py` file, import the OpenAI package and Telebot package
2. Implement the function for calling the GPT-3 API and generating a response
3. In the Telegram bot handling function, call the GPT-3 function and use the generated response as the bot's reply using telebot


## Conclusion
Congratulations, you have successfully created and deployed a Telegram bot using Flask, Webhooks, and Vercel. You have also added the functionality of GPT-3 to generate responses for your bot using Telebot.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or issues. Happy coding!
